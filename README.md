# Overview

These are a couple of example Verilog programs for Lattice's "Icestick" evaluation board, which is based around their iCE40 line of FPGA. Makefiles are provieded, using the Icestorm toolchain written by Clifford Wolf et al.

After installing the Icestorm tools, just run `make` to build an example. To upload the code to the board, run `make flash`.
